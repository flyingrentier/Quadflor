# the structure should be like this:
#
# for random search, specify the following format:
# <parameter_name_1>,<lower_bound_1>,<upper_bound_1>,<space_type_1>
# ...
# <parameter_name_n>,<lower_bound_n>,<upper_bound_n>,<space_type_n>
# example:
#learning_rate,-9.21,-2.3,loguniform
#dropout,0.05,0.95,uniform
#
# for bayesian optimization, specify in the following format:
# <parameter_name_1>,<lower_bound_1>,<upper_bound_1>,<init_value_1_1>,<init_value_1_m>
# ...
# <parameter_name_n>,<lower_bound_n>,<upper_bound_n>,<init_value_n>,<init_value_n_m>
# example:
learning_rate,0.0001,1,0.1,0.01,0.111
dropout,0.05,0.95,0.05,0.5,0.555
#
# for grid search, specify in the following format:
# <parameter_name_1>,<type_1>,<value_1>,..,<value_n_1>
# ...
# <parameter_name_m>,<type_m>,<value_1>,...,<value_n_m>
# example:
#learning_rate,float,0.01,0.005,0.001
#dropout,float,0.5,0.05,0.95
